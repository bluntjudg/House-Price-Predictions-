# House-Price-Predictions-
This project is divided into Train dataset and Test dataset and prediction is based on both the dataset to cross check the sales price and sales conditions


Train data and code file is the dataset on which the model is trained based on the sales price & the test data is trained based on the sales condition 

main motive of the project is how correcty we apply the models to check and get the accuracy values

Here the Decision Tree gives the most accurate value whereas you can add more models to check the accuracy points to fit the model based on the output
